Spring Boot Docker Example
==========================
This is an example Spring Boot "Hello World" micro-service application that can be containerized and subsequently executed in Docker, Kubernetes, and Google App Engine!

This is not an official Google product.

Building
========
Regular Maven build:

    mvn package
    
Build Docker container:

    mvn docker:build

Running
=======
Java
----
Pretty straight forward:

    mvn exec:java

Docker
------
Without Redis for session:

    docker run -ti spring-boot-demo

With Redis for session:

    docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
    docker run -ti --rm --link redis:redis -p 8080:8080 spring-boot-demo

Docker Compose
--------------
Docker Compose uses a descriptor to describe the Docker container and linking configurations.
Rather than manually executing commands like the previous section, you can start the demo with Redis by running:

    cd src/test/docker-compose
    docker-compose up
    
The configuration is stored in `docker-compose.yml`

Kubernetes
----------
The following instructions assume that you already have Kubernetes cluster up and running.  If not, check out [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) to get started quickly.

Change directory to where all the Kubernetes configuration files are:

    cd src/test/kubernetes

Deploy Redis master pod:

    kubectl create -f redis-master-pod.yaml
    
Create a Redis master service:

    kubectl create -f redis-master-service.yaml
    
Deploy Spring Boot Demo replication controller:

    kubectl create -f spring-boot-demo-controller.yaml
    
Create a service:

    kubectl create -f spring-boot-demo-service.yaml
    
If you are on Google Container Engine, or Kubernetes deployment that supports external services, you can create an external service:

    kubectl create -f spring-boot-demo-external-service.yaml

Google App Engine
-----------------
The instruction assumes that you have [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) already installed and that you are familiar with [Google App Engine Managed VMs](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/managed-vms/).

To run locally:

    mvn gcloud:run
    
To deploy into Google App Engine, you'll first need to create a Redis server.  You can deploy Redis easily by using [Click to Deploy](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/redis/).

Once deployed, update `src/main/resources/application-gae.properties` file, and set:

    spring.redis.host=YOUR_REDIS_MASTER_INSTANCE_NAME
    
Build the Docker image, so that it generates Dockerfile

    mvn docker:build

Finally, deploy the application using `gcloud` plugin:

    mvn gcloud:deploy -Dgcloud.project=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
